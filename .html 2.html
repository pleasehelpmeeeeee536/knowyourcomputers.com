<h1> INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER</h1>
<p>A computer is a programmable electronic machine used to store, retrieve, and process data. They are used to type documents, send e-mail, play games, browse the Internet, create presentations, event invitations, and listen to music or watch videos.</p>
<h3> EVOLUTION OF COMPUTERS</h3>
<p>  The evalution of computer is devided into three eras</p>
<li> The Mechanical Age: 1450 – 1840.</li>
<li> The Electromechanical Age: 1840 - 1940. </li>
<li> The Electronic Age: 1940 - Present. </li>
<h2> The Mechanical Age: 1450 – 1840. </h2>
<p>During the mechanical period dating back to 3000 BCE, early humans started communicating using pictograms, stone tablets, and eventually paper. Libraries emerged as places to store compiled books and served as early data centers. Numerical systems and counting devices like the abacus also spread some important machines of this era are:</p>
<h2>ABACUS</h2>
</p>An abacus is a manual tool used to keep track of numbers and to perform basic mathematical operations. Abaci have been in use in various parts of the world for over 4,000 years. Even in the modern digital age, abaci remain popular for certain applications in accounting, education, and for use in austere environments.</p>
<h2>NAPPIER BONES</h2>
<p>Napier's bones are an abacus invented by John Napier for calculation of products and quotients of numbers. Also called Rabdology (from Greek ραβδoς [rabdos], rod and λóγoς [logos], word). Napier published his invention of the rods in a work printed in Edinburgh, Scotland, at the end of 1617 entitled Rabdologiæ.</p>
<h2>SLIDE RULE</h2>
<p>A slide rule is a hand-operated mechanical calculator consisting of slidable rulers for evaluating mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, exponents, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry. It is one of the simplest analog computers.</p>
<h2>PASCALINE or PASCALS's CALCULATOR</h2>
<p>Pascaline, the first calculator or adding machine to be produced in any quantity and actually used. The Pascaline was designed and built by the French mathematician-philosopher Blaise Pascal between 1642 and 1644. It could only do addition and subtraction, with numbers being entered by manipulating its dials.</p>
<h2>LEIBNIZ's CALCULATOR</h2>
<p>It is the type of machine which is used for calculating the engine of a class of mechanical calculators. Leibniz calculator is known for its strong advocate in the binary system. It is also known as the first true four-function calculator. It was the first successful mechanical calculator.</p>
<h2>BABBAGE ANALYTICAL AND DIFFERENCE ENGINE</h2>
<P>In 1834, with the Difference Engine project stalled, Babbage conceived of a more ambitious and technically more demanding machine. The Analytical Engine was designed to perform any calculation set before it and to have even higher powers of analysis than the original Difference Engine.</P>
<h2>The Electromechanical Age: 1840 - 1940</h2>
<p>The electromechanical age can be defined as the time between 1840 and 1940. These are the beginnings of telecommunication. The telegraph was created in the early 1800s. Morse code was created by Samuel Morse in 1835.</p>
<h2>TABULATING MACHINE</h2>
<p>The tabulating machine was an electromechanical machine designed to assist in summarizing information stored on punched cards. Invented by Herman Hollerith, the machine was developed to help process data for the 1890 U.S. Census.</p>
<h2>The Electronic Age: 1940 - Present</h2>
<p>The electronic age is wha we currently live in. It can be defined as the time between 1940 and right now. The ENIAC was the first high-speed, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems. This computer was designed to be used by the U.S. Army for artillery firing tables.</p>
<h2>FIRST GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1940 to 1956)</h2>
<P>The period 1940 to 1956, roughly considered as the First Generation of Computer. The first generation computers were developed by using vacuum tube or thermionic valve machine. The input of this system was based on punched cards and paper tape; however, the output was displayed on printouts.</P>
<h2>SECOND GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1956 to 1963)</h2>
<P>The Second Generation Computers were invented during 1956-1963. These computers were built using transistors as the basic component instead of vacuum tubes. The development of computers is like a fascinating story. A long time ago, people started with big, mechanical machines designed to do complex calculations.</P>
<h2>THIRD GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1963 to 1971)</h2>
<P>Third-generation computers used integrated circuits in place of transistors. With the use of integrated circuits, these computers became reliable, generated less heat, were small in size, fast, very less maintenance, and were inexpensive. It was developed in 1958 by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby.</P>
<H2>FOURTH GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1971 to Present)</H2>
<P>Fourth Generation of computers was between 1971 – 1980. These computers used the VLSI technology or the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology. Therefore they were also known as the microprocessors. Intel was the first company to develop a microprocessor.</P>
<H2>FIFTH GENERATION OF COMPUTER (Present to Beyond)</H2>
<P>Fifth generation computing devices are based on artificial intelligence and include some applications in use today, such as voice recognition, though development is ongoing. Artificial intelligence involves using computers to behave like humans and was coined in 1956.</P>
